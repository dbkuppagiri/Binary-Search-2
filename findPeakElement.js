/**
  Intuition is to use binary search as the requirement is to write an algorithm which completes in O(log n)
  I am moving my pointers towards the peak always, if the peak resides on the left iam moving my right pointer towards mid 
  otherwise left pointer to the right.
  Time complexity : O(log n)
  Space Complexity: O(1) as i am not using any extra space other than left and right pointers.
